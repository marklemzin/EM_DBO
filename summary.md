## Stocks

SAHA (epigenetic modifier) was dissolved in 100% etoh to 2 mg/mL. SAHA was used at a final concentration of 25 µg/mL, so ethanol to the final concentration of 1.25% was used as the positive control.

DBO was dissolved in mq-H2O to 2 mg/mL.
## Growth curves

Growth of PAO1 over 15-24h at 37C. Shown is mean OD600 of 3 biological replicates. Time given in hours.

Treatment conditions are SAHA 25 µg/mL (saha), 1.25% ethanol (etoh), both SAHA 25 µg/mL and DBO 25 µg/mL (combo), and both SAHA 25 µg/mL and DBO 50 µg/mL (xDBO; extra-dbo).

## Swarming

Swarming on M8 media over 24h at 37C. 0.5% agar used in media.

Columns of the 24-well plate, from left-to-right, have decreasing concentrations of SAHA.
The leftmost wells (1) contain SAHA 100 µg/mL, then (2) contains 50 µg/mL, (3) contains 25 µg/mL and so on.

Rows, from top-to-bottom, have decreasing concentrations of DBO. The topmost wells (A) contain DBO 100 µg/mL, then (B) contains 50 µg/mL and so on.

This used assay used a lot of drug, so it was performed only once. Bottom-right wells were not inoculated. Large agar bubbles would have interfered with swarming.

## Biofilms

MBIC's for copper and conventional antibiotics in MHB-II. In addition, 96-well plates were treated with a background concentration of DBO 25 µg/mL (D25), SAHA 25 µg/mL (S25), or both DBO 25 µg/mL and SAHA 25 µg/mL (SD).
